> **Discontinued**
> As of [Towny 0.96.5.2](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/releases/tag/0.96.5.2), Towny is able to keep track of player UUIDs on it's own.  
> Therefore, the use of TownyNameUpdater is no longer required.

## TownyNameUpdater
Originally developed and designed by [backcab](https://github.com/xf57212/TownyNameUpdater), and maintained by the [TownyAdvanced project](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced).

This project was a requirement for [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny), versions 0.89.2.2 &ndash; 0.96.5.1, on Bukkit-based servers operating in online mode, and was used to track username changes.
